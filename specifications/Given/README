Haskell program: 
Use the fact that NFA has five elements to it:
finite set of states - Q
finite set of input symbols - sigma
transition relation - delta: QxSigma -> P(Q)
an initial state

*Inputs 
put the list of inputed lists to test 

*NFA
Built by some other code, used to pop elements off the list

*Final States 
the final states of there machine, does not have to be with the 
other functions
